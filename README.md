# Elevvo Internship Tasks (2025)

Internship projects completed at **Elevvo** during 2025.  
This repository contains a collection of **machine learning and deep learning projects** covering regression, classification, clustering, recommendation systems, forecasting, and computer vision. Each project was implemented using **Python** and popular ML/DL libraries.

## Completed Projects

### 1. Student Score Prediction

Predict exam scores using **Linear and Polynomial Regression** on multiple features from the dataset.  
**Evaluation:** MSE and R^2
**Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

### 2. Customer Segmentation

Grouped customers into segments with **K-Means Clustering** on the Mall Customers dataset.  
**Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn

### 3. Forest Cover Type Classification

Classified forest cover types with the UCI Covertype dataset, comparing **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models.  
**Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, xgboost, pandas

### 4. Loan Approval Prediction

Predicted loan approval decisions, handled missing values and categorical features, addressed imbalance with **SMOTE**.  
**Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, pandas

### 5. Movie Recommendation System

Built a recommendation engine using **User-based Collaborative Filtering**.  
**Evaluation:** Precision@K  
**Libraries:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, surprise

### 6. Sales Forecasting

Predicted Walmart sales using historical data, created time-based features, applied models like **XGBoost**.  
**Libraries:** Python, xgboost, pandas, scikit-learn

### 7. Traffic Sign Recognition

Classified traffic signs using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, applied **data augmentation** to improve performance.  
**Libraries:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
